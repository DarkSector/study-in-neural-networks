# Study in Neural Networks
My attempt to demystify neural networks in a journey of understanding LLMs

## Motivation

I am a big dummy. I need to understand things visually and from scratch. That mean re-plotting things like basic mathematical functions, getting better at using Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib and Juptyer noteboks. The final objective is to understand how the much revered transformer works. 


## Methodology

Start from the basics. Understand hyperplanes, gradient descent, activation functions then slowly move up to Neural Networks (even basic stuff like Perceptrons). Eventually get to Attention and LLMs. 

I am also pursuing a course on this through Udemy. It'll help speed things up
